# Survival-LCS: Rule-Based Survival Analysis Without Proportional Hazard Assumptions

Survival analysis is crucial in modeling time-to-event data across biomedical research, epidemiology, and engineering. Traditional methods often rely on restrictive assumptions and face challenges in handling the complexities of real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce the Survival Learning Classifier System (Survival-LCS), an extension of the ExSTraCS algorithm specifically designed for survival analysis. Survival-LCS supports right-censored data, diverse feature types, and missing data while eliminating the need for baseline hazard or survival distribution assumptions, providing a flexible and robust approach to survival modeling.

We extend the evaluation of Survival-LCS by incorporating a wider range of baseline distributions and testing its performance on an expanded set of simulated datasets generated with GAMETES software. These datasets include various genetic architectures, epistatic, additive, heterogeneous, and univariate models, alongside varying censoring proportions, minor allele frequencies, and feature dimensions. This comprehensive sensitivity analysis reveals Survival-LCSâ€™s capability to detect complex, non-linear survival patterns without underlying proportional hazard assumptions. Using Integrated Brier Scores as a key metric, we assess its predictive accuracy for survival times under different distributions. Our findings explore challenges to the algorithm with data distributions, and the potential of Survival-LCS to overcome traditional limitations, offering significant applications in various domains of survival analysis.
